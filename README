Multilanguage (l10n) Injection for Flex (v1.0 beta 1.1)

Integrating IoC concepts with the power of MXML, this library provides a powerful, easy framework for runtime injection of localized resources (strings, bitmaps, skins, etc.) in Flex 2/3/4 views and models.
Using a single LocalizationMap instance, developers can centralize all mappings of localized resources to specific destinations and usages. Whenever the locale changes, resources are re-injected into specified destinations.

Please review the WIKI docs and blogs at http://www.gridlinked.info for details and tutorials.

This GIT repository contains the both: 

   1) the source code for the l10nInjection.swc flex library, and 
   2) the FlashBuilder 4 Flex library project settings
