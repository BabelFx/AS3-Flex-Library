BabelFx Framework: Multi-language (l10n) Injection for Flex and Flash applications (aka l10nInjection). 

Combining IoC concepts with the power of MXML, this library provides a powerful, easy framework for run-time 
injection of localized resources (strings, bitmaps, skins, etc.) into Flex GUI views and non-DisplayObject models 
and business classes. This solution can be used with ANY framework within Flex 3 or Flex 4 and has been tested 
with sample applications using Swiz, Cairngorm, Mate, or no application framework at all. 

Simple rebuild or include the l10nInjection.swc in your custom project, create a custom LocalizationMap, add an 
instance of that LocalizationMap to your application and your immediately have multi-language support. Using a 
single LocalizationMap instance, developers can centralize all mappings of localized resources to specific 
destinations and usages. Whenever the locale changes, resources are re-injected into specified destinations. In fact 
the l10nInjection can occur upon locale changes, model changes, view state changes, or GUI instantiations... 
full power for all your needs. The l10nInjection solution can be used:

    Within custom Flex 3 or Flex 4 solutions 
    Within AIR deployments or Web-only solutions. 
    Within modules or applications.

Please review the WIKI docs and blogs at http://www.gridlinked.info for details and tutorials. This GIT repository 
contains the both: 

   1) the source code for the l10nInjection.swc flex library, and 
   2) the FlashBuilder 4 Flex library project settings
